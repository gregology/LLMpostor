"""
Smoke Test Suite - Basic Application Flows

This test suite provides automated smoke tests for critical user journeys:
1. Basic room join/leave cycle
2. Full game round: join → respond → guess → results  
3. Error handling paths
4. Connection reliability

These tests are designed to catch major regressions and validate that the core
application functionality works end-to-end.
